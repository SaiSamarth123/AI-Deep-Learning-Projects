# NLP and ChatBots with spaCy, NLTK, and LSTM

## Project Overview

This project explores the application of natural language processing (NLP) to build a chatbot using LSTM neural networks. The chatbot is trained on preprocessed conversation data to respond to user inputs dynamically.

## Key Concepts

- **spaCy and NLTK**: Used for text preprocessing, including tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A type of recurrent neural network used to understand context and generate responses based on sequential data.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Essential for cleaning and preparing text data for modeling, ensuring better performance and accuracy.

## Implementation

- Text data is preprocessed using spaCy and NLTK to extract meaningful tokens.
- An LSTM model is trained on the preprocessed data to predict the next word in a conversation sequence.
- The chatbot interacts with users in real-time by predicting responses using the trained LSTM model.

## Usage

The chatbot can be integrated into customer service to provide responses to user inquiries, making it a useful tool for automating interactions.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of advanced NLP techniques and LSTM networks to create a responsive and interactive chatbot, highlighting the potential of AI in enhancing user interaction and automation.
