# Self-Driving Car (PPO)
# Import necessary libraries
import gym  # Gym is used for creating and managing the environment
import spinup.algos.pytorch.ppo.core as core  # Import the PPO core from Spinning Up library

# Create the environment
# Assuming 'SelfDrivingCar-v0' is a placeholder for a real Gym environment suitable for PPO
env = gym.make("SelfDrivingCar-v0")

# Obtain the number of possible actions from the environment's action space
num_actions = env.action_space.n

# Train the PPO model
# `env_fn` is a function that creates an instance of the environment
# `ac_kwargs` specifies arguments for the actor-critic neural networks, such as the size of hidden layers

# Reset the environment to start testing the trained model
obs = env.reset()  # Reset the environment and get the initial observation
done = False  # Initialize 'done' flag to False, indicating the episode is not over

# This will simulate interaction with the environment using the trained PPO model
while not done:
    # Assuming `model` is defined and loaded with the trained PPO policy
    # Here, `model.predict` is used to select actions based on the model's policy, given current observations
    action, _states = model.predict(obs)
    # Apply the action to the environment, get new observation, reward, and whether the episode is done
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    # Render the environment to visualize the agent's behavior in the environment
    env.render()

# Close the environment after testing is complete
env.close()
