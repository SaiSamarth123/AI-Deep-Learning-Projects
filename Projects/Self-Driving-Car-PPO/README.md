# Self-Driving Car with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

## Project Overview

This project utilizes Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a reinforcement learning algorithm, to train a self-driving car in a simulated environment. The goal is to develop an autonomous agent capable of making intelligent driving decisions.

## Key Concepts

- **Reinforcement Learning**: An area of machine learning concerned with how agents ought to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: A policy gradient method for reinforcement learning which alternates between sampling data through interaction with the environment, and optimizing a "surrogate" objective function using stochastic gradient ascent.
- **Environment**: A simulation (`SelfDrivingCar-v0`) where the agent learns to drive. The environment provides the agent with observations and rewards based on its actions.

## Implementation

- The project is implemented using the `gym` library for creating the environment and `spinup` from OpenAI for the PPO algorithm.
- The model is trained to predict the optimal actions from environmental states, adjusting its policy parameters to maximize expected future rewards.

## Usage

- The trained model can be tested in the environment to evaluate its performance and ability to drive the car autonomously without human input.
- The system's capabilities include navigating through a track, avoiding obstacles, and making dynamic decisions based on real-time environmental changes.

## Conclusion

This application of PPO to control a self-driving car demonstrates the potential of reinforcement learning algorithms to handle complex, real-world tasks like autonomous driving.
