# Kernel PCA with Logistic Regression

## Overview

This project applies Kernel Principal Component Analysis (Kernel PCA) followed by logistic regression to classify types of wine based on their chemical properties. The dataset consists of different physicochemical tests from various wines.

## Key Concepts

### Kernel PCA

Kernel PCA is an extension of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that uses kernel methods to project data into a higher-dimensional space before performing linear PCA. This approach is particularly useful for non-linear datasets where traditional PCA fails to capture the essential structure effectively.

- **Kernel Trick**: Kernel PCA uses the kernel trick to handle the transformation of data into higher dimensions without explicitly computing the coordinates in that space, which can be computationally expensive.
- **RBF Kernel**: The Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel is a popular choice for Kernel PCA, as it can map non-linear relationships effectively.

### Logistic Regression

After dimensionality reduction, logistic regression, a linear model for binary classification, is used to predict the type of wine. It models the probability of a sample belonging to one of the classes.

### Visualization

The project includes visualizations of the decision boundaries derived from the logistic regression model on both the training and test sets. These plots provide insight into the classification accuracy and how well the Kernel PCA has transformed the feature space to make it linearly separable to some extent.

## Results

The confusion matrix and accuracy score are used to evaluate the model's performance. These metrics help in assessing the effectiveness of Kernel PCA in conjunction with logistic regression for classification tasks.
