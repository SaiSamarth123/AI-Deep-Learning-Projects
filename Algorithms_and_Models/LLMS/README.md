# Fine-Tuning LLMs with Hugging Face

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pretrained Large Language Model (LLM) using Hugging Face's libraries. LLMs, such as the one used in this project, are advanced AI models trained on extensive text datasets. They understand and generate human-like text, enabling them to perform tasks like translation, summarization, and question answering.

## Setup and Installation

### Dependencies

- Install necessary Python packages like `accelerate`, `peft`, `bitsandbytes`, and `transformers` to handle model optimization and training workflows efficiently.

### Importing Libraries

- Import essential libraries from PyTorch, Hugging Face's `transformers`, and other supporting libraries to enable data handling and model manipulation.

## Model and Tokenizer Loading

- Load the pretrained LLM and corresponding tokenizer from Hugging Face's model hub. Configure model quantization for efficient training and inference.

## Training Preparation

- Set up training arguments specifying batch sizes, training steps, and output directories.
- Initialize a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) trainer with specific configurations for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PeFT) and the dataset.

## Model Training

- Train the model using the SFT trainer on a medical terms dataset, fine-tuning the model to better understand and generate medical content.

## Interaction with the Model

- Implement a text generation pipeline to interact with the fine-tuned model, enabling it to answer queries about medical conditions effectively.

## Conclusion

The fine-tuning process customizes the LLM to perform well on specialized tasks like medical term explanation, showcasing the versatility of transformer models and Hugging Face tools.
