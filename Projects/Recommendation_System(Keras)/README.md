# Recommender Systems with Keras

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a recommender system using Keras by leveraging embeddings to predict user preferences for movies. The system uses collaborative filtering techniques to recommend movies to users based on learned embeddings for both movies and users.

## Key Concepts

- **Embeddings**: Vector representations for movies and users, capturing preferences and characteristics in a dense form.
- **Sequential Model**: A Keras model that sequentially adds layers to combine embeddings and make predictions.
- **Dot Product**: Used to calculate similarity scores between user and movie embeddings, influencing the predicted ratings.

## Implementation

- The system initializes separate embeddings for users and movies, which are then processed through a neural network to predict interaction outcomes.
- Training involves adjusting the embeddings to minimize the discrepancy between predicted and actual ratings, using binary cross-sectional loss to handle rating predictions as probabilities.

## Usage

The model provides personalized movie recommendations by predicting the likelihood of a user liking each movie, based on their embedded profile.

## Conclusion

This Keras-based recommender system showcases a fundamental approach to building recommendation engines that can be extended and customized for different types of item-user interactions in various domains.
