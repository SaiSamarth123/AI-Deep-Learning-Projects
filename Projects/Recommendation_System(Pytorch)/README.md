# Recommender Systems

## Project Overview

This project develops a recommendation system using a collaborative filtering approach implemented with PyTorch. The system predicts user preferences for movies based on past user interactions.

## Key Concepts

- **Embeddings**: Utilizes user and movie embeddings to capture preferences and features.
- **Model Architecture**: Combines embeddings and processes them through a neural network to predict ratings.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: This method predicts a user's rating based on the ratings from similar users and similar items.

## Implementation

- Data on users, movies, and ratings are loaded and preprocessed.
- A `RecommendationModel` class is defined using PyTorch, incorporating embeddings and a linear layer to predict ratings.
- The model is trained on historical ratings data, learning to minimize the mean squared error between predicted and actual ratings.
- Recommendations are generated by predicting ratings for a combination of user and all movies.

## Usage

The trained model can suggest movies to users based on their historical preferences, assisting in personalizing user experience on platforms.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the implementation of a basic recommender system using deep learning techniques, providing a foundation for more complex and scalable recommendation engines.
