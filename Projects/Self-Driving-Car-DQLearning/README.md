# Self-Driving Car Simulation with Deep Q-Learning

## Project Overview

This project implements a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm to train a self-driving car within a simulated environment. The goal is to develop an autonomous agent capable of navigating complex traffic scenarios without human intervention.

## Key Concepts

- **Deep Q-Learning**: An advanced reinforcement learning algorithm that combines Q-Learning with deep neural networks to approximate the optimal action-value function.
- **Environment Wrapping**: Utilizes the DeepMind wrappers for the gym environment to apply modifications like frame skipping and color rendering, enhancing the agent's learning capability.
- **Q-Network**: A neural network model that learns to predict the optimal action from a given state by maximizing the expected value of the total reward.

## Implementation

- The project is built on Python, using libraries such as `gym` for creating the simulation environment and `baselines` for robust RL algorithm implementations.
- The self-driving car environment (`SelfDrivingCar-v0`) is wrapped with DeepMindâ€™s common Atari wrappers to preprocess observations and add functionality such as frame stacking for temporal difference learning.
- The DQN model is trained over millions of timesteps to effectively learn complex driving strategies through trial and error.

## Usage

The trained model acts within the simulation to make real-time decisions, predicting and executing actions based on the current observed state of the environment. It is capable of:

- Navigating through various traffic scenarios.
- Avoiding collisions and maintaining safe driving protocols.
- Adapting to dynamic changes in the environment.

## Conclusion

This DQN-based approach demonstrates a robust method for training autonomous agents in complex, high-dimensional environments. It provides foundational insights into the applications of reinforcement learning in autonomous vehicle technology, showing potential for real-world adaptations.
