# Fraud Detector Using Autoencoders

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of autoencoders to detect fraudulent transactions within credit card data. By training the model on normal transaction data, the autoencoder learns to reconstruct these inputs with minimal error. Transactions that result in high reconstruction errors are flagged as potential frauds.

## Key Concepts

- **Autoencoders**: Neural networks that learn efficient codings by training the network to ignore signal “noise.”
- **Data Standardization**: StandardScaler is used to normalize the features of the dataset, which enhances the training stability.
- **Reconstruction Error**: The discrepancy between the input and reconstructed output is used to detect anomalies. A high error suggests unusual patterns in the data, possibly indicating fraud.

## Implementation

- The data is preprocessed using standard scaling.
- An autoencoder architecture is defined with Keras, including encoding and decoding layers.
- The model is trained on the credit card transaction data, learning to minimize reconstruction error on normal transactions.
- After training, transactions that significantly deviate from the reconstructed input (beyond a set threshold) are considered fraudulent.

## Usage

This model can be utilized by financial institutions to enhance security measures by identifying and investigating anomalous transactions potentially indicative of fraud.

## Conclusion

By leveraging the power of autoencoders in anomaly detection, this project provides a methodical approach to identifying fraudulent activities in large-scale transaction datasets.
